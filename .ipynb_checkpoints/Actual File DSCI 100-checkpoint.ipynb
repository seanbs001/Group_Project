    "Some movies display intense violence, drug use, nudity, and harsh language, ergo it is crucial that parents are aware of the content before viewing a film with their child. That is why the widely adopted Classification and Rating Administration, or “CARA”, was developed by the Motion Picture Association in 1968: to inform parents of a movie content’s maturity by categorizing films into bins (*Motion Picture Association*, 2020). The bins are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **G** (General Audiences)\n",
    "* **PG** (Parental Guidance Suggested)\n",
    "* **PG-13** (Parents Strongly Cautioned)\n",
    "* **R** (Restricted)\n",
    "* **NC-17** (Adults Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "This discovery led us to inquire if a movie category could be predicted before officially being categorized. This might help CARA analysts better understand where a movie may fall before reviewing it. After exploring various options, this is the predictive question we designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given a movie’s run time, votes, and IMDb rating, can we predict the category?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that will be used is called IMDb Top 100 Movies (Pathak, 2023). Using the list of the top 100 movies from 1972 to 2015 according to IMDb (*IMDb*, n.d.), we will predict movies’ category based on the variables stated above. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/themrityunjaypathak/imdb-top-100-movies."
